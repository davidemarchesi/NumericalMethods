# Practical Problems
In this section will be listed some real-life problems to solve with the application of both Numerical
or Analytical methods.
*(Nb. These problems were assigned, in italian lanuguage, as a facultative project by my Numerical Methods university 
professor. The solutions listed are all given by me according to what, in my opinion, I thought fit best to the problem)*
