# Numerical Methods
Like in the previously description is said, this repository has the aim to collect and explain all the main mathematical numerical methods to solve
complex, or either impossible, mathematical models of real physical problems.

**All the treatment will be made with the MATLAB (or either OCTAVE) code language**

In this repository you will find a **LaTex file**, explaining briefly the theory behind the numerical models, and in each folder you will find every referred method `code` with also examples of it.
