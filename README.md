# Numerical Methods
This repository has the aim to collect and explain the main mathematical numerical methods to solve
complex models of real physical problems.

**All the discussion is made with MATLAB code language**

In each folder you will find every the referred method `code` with also examples of it.

This repository was developed while following the course of Numerical Methods at my last year of BSc.
